      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>All students and staff of the College are entitled to register as members 
        of the Library and Resource Centre and to use the facilities for the purpose 
        of their course of study or College employment. </p>
    
    
      <p>Membership may also be extended to other individuals and to persons nominated 
        from other organisations:  a fee is usually charged.  Access to the Library 
        and Resource Centre for study purposes may be made available to non-members 
        by arrangement. Details are available in the External Services leaflet.</p>
    
    
      <p>Use of facilities implies acceptance of the Library and Resource Centre 
        rules printed below.  These are designed to protect the interests of all 
        users of Library and Resource Centre and to ensure that the College operates 
        within the law and can carry out its functions efficiently and effectively.  
        The Library and Resource Centre rules apply in principle to all sites, 
        including workstation rooms and site libraries, notwithstanding some variations 
        in practice in the site libraries. Admission to the Library and Resource Centre 
        is conditional upon observation of the rules and the staff are empowered 
        to enforce them. </p>
    
    
      <p>Breaches of the rules may be dealt with by specific Library and Resource 
        Centre Disciplinary Action (see below), including the withdrawal of some 
        access, and if appropriate by invoking the College’s Regulations for Students, 
        in the case of students, or in the case of staff through the appropriate 
        College procedures as set out in the Staff Handbook. </p>

    <div class="content-rules">
      <h4>Rules</h4>
      <ol><b>Access</b>
          <li>The use of Library and Resource Centre facilities is normally 
              limited to use for the educational and other purposes of the College.</li>
  
          <li>All individuals wishing to become members of the Library and Resource 
              Centre must comply with the registration procedures.  These include 
              an undertaking to abide by Library and Resource Centre rules.</li>
              
          <li>Individuals or organisations who are not eligible for membership but 
              have good reason to use the Library and Resource Centre  may be admitted, 
              by arrangement, for purposes of study only. Procedures for seeking admission 
              are outlined in the External Services leaflet. Non-members must sign the 
              Visitors' Book on each visit, and may be required to produce written identification.  
              Study use does not include access to the College's Academic Network.</li>
  
          <li>ID cards issued by the College are not transferable from one person to another.  
              The person named on each card is responsible for all items borrowed on it and 
              is liable for the cost of replacement of the card or items borrowed on it in 
              the event of loss or damage.
          <p><i>Users of the Library and Resource Centre are reminded that they 
              must be willing to show  ID cards or other identification when 
              requested to do so by College staff.</i></p></li>
      </ol>
  
  
      <ol><b>Use of facilities</b>
          <li>The Library and Resource Centre is not responsible for loss of, or damage to, 
              the personal belongings of its users and visitors.  Users must take reasonable 
              precautions against theft of their belongings, and must not leave belongings 
              unattended even for a very short period. Study tables/PCs may not be reserved 
              by depositing clothing or private property on the adjacent seat.  
              Articles left unattended may be removed by staff but will be returned on 
              request at the Reception Desk.</li>
  
          <li>All users are required to conduct themselves quietly throughout the Library 
              and Resource Centre and conversation between users must be kept to a minimum.  
              No conversation is permitted in those areas designated as ‘Silent’ areas.</li>
  
          <li>Personal stereos may not be used in the Library and Resource Centre.</li>
  
          <li>Mobile phones must be turned off in all Library and Resource Centre study 
              areas. Their use is permitted in the enclosed stair wells of the Main Site 
              building.</li>
  
          <li>Users should not make use of mains electrical supplies to power their own 
              equipment, including external storage devices,  unless the equipment has 
              been tested and confirmed as meeting the required Health & Safety standards.  
              Written evidence of such compliance will be required.</li>
  
          <li>Eating and drinking are not permitted in any of the public areas of the 
              Library and Resource Centre.</li>
  
          <li>Action will be taken against any person misusing furniture, facilities or materials.  
              Any such person may be required to pay for the making good damage or loss.</li>
